  <b>Creating, saving, and viewing an HTML document</b>
  <p>Creating an HTML document is even easier than turning your computer on. All you need to do is open any text editor, type the code, and then save the file with a “.html” / “. htm” extension. To view the file, just double click on it and it will automatically open in your web browser. If you want to edit a file, just right click and open it with the text editor.</p>
  <p> Here, you <b>don't even need to do that!</b> We have an HTML editor where you can practice your skills. Go ahead, type something and see it show up in the box to the right!</p>
